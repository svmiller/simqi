    <p>Missingness is substantial for one reason or the other. The data are complete
cases only. It's not problematic for this purpose, but I did want to make a
note of it.</p>
<p>The political trust variable is a simple latent estimate derived from a graded
response model of the items from the original data on trust in government
(<code>aa10a</code>), trust in parliament (<code>aa10n</code>), trust in the political parties
(<code>aa10q</code>), and trust in Swedish politicians (<code>ab12</code>). The first three items
were on 1-5 scales while the last one (about Swedish politicians) is on a 1-4
scale. All items were reverse coded from their original scales and the user
should interpret the ensuing latent estimate to be communicating higher
political trust with higher values on the scale. The user is also free to
question just how valid of a measure of political trust this is, though I will
only add that the factor loadings for all four items were as low as .81 and as
high as .91. The proportional variance is .764.</p>
<p>The variables for satisfaction with democracy, trust in the royal family,
attitude about the European Union, and interest in politics are reverse coded
from their original scale.</p>
<p>SOM is unique from other long-standing survey data sets of which I'm aware
by allowing respondents to self-identify as some other gender. In 2019 and
2020, only 71 of 21,195 respondents self-identified this way (before any
other case-exclusions). I remove these observations from the data.</p>
<p>If I understand the codebook correctly, the household income variable is coded
by SOM's researchers and is not a self-placement by the respondent.</p>
<p>You may want to explicitly factor the residential area variable, though this
is basically how it was presented in the data.</p>
