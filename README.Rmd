`{simqi}` allows researchers to simulate so-called "quantities of interest" from common regression models. This method of generating quantities of interest comes by of a simulation from the multivariate normal distribution, where the vector of means if the regression coefficients and the sigma is the variance-covariance matrix of the regression model.

# Installation

You can also install the development version of this package through the `{devtools}` package.

```r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/simqi")
