## Test environment

- Pop! OS 22.04, R 4.1.2

## Initial Comments to CRAN

R CMD check done via `devtools::check()`, resulting in 0 errors, 0 warnings and 0 notes.

`devtools::spell_check()` results in a lot of typos, all of which are false positives.

This is a new package of mine that I want as an initial development offering of mine.
