    #    the unique values (unique), and convert them to a numeric.
    #  - Then, we'll just add an element to it that is the max of it, plus one.

    #  going to subtract the xbs from the thresholds. "Subbies" is going to take
    #  some of the code that I commented out above, simplifying identifying which
    #  columns in simmies have those thresholds. Then, apply() is going to take
    #  the sss column (matching the dimensions that will ultimately come) and apply
    #  the function. The 2 you see applies to the margin argument, indicating you
    #  you should apply this to the column.
