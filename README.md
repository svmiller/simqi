`{simqi}` allows researchers to simulate so-called “quantities of
interest” from common regression models. This method of generating
quantities of interest comes by of a simulation from the multivariate
normal distribution, where the vector of means if the regression
coefficients and the sigma is the variance-covariance matrix of the
regression model.
